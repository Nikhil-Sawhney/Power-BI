# Project Title - Energy Consumption Dashbaord
The dataset contains an excel file containing 

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
The company responsible for supplying energy (water, electricity, and gas) to various buildings across countries is facing challenges in effectively managing and optimizing energy distribution. They lack a comprehensive view of energy consumption patterns, leading to inefficiencies, high costs, and difficulties in meeting sustainability targets. They need a solution to monitor and analyze energy usage data across all buildings to identify areas for improvement, reduce waste, and ensure reliable and sustainable energy supply.

# MY APPROACH
My human resource analysis was more focused on Diversity and Inclusion in respect to the Gender, Race and Sexuality of the workforce to answer the business question.

# Insights gained from the analysis include:
* Evidence of a particular race dominating the workforce,
* Likewise, the male gender dominates other genders,
* Same pattern was found in the sexuality context within the company as most employees are heterosexuals,
* Furthermore, the female employees and have smaller numbers in the managerial role and are non-existent in the director role compared to the male gender.

These highlights are pointing to a possible bias within the company's culture.
