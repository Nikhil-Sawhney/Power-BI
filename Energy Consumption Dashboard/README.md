# Project Title - Energy Consumption Dashbaord
The dataset contains an excel file containing 

# Problem Statement
Problem Statement: 
A company responsible for supplying energy (water, electricity, and gas) to various buildings across different countries faces the challenge of effectively monitoring and managing energy consumption to ensure efficient operations and cost-effectiveness. However, without a centralized system to track and analyze energy usage data, the company struggles to identify trends, anomalies, and opportunities for improvement, leading to inefficiencies, increased costs, and potential service disruptions.

# My Approach
Creating a Dashboard, showing trends of unit consumption with total cost generated from it for different types of energy (water, electrcity and gas).

# Process Involved
* Use of Power Query to clean and transform raw data for analysis.
* Creating some measures using DAX for the dashboard.
* Use of different visulizations to create a dashboard.

# Few Insights gained from the analysis include:
* At 186,245,327 (18.6M approximately) Water had the highest total consumption and was 71.95% higher than Gas which has lowest consumption at 2,553,088 (2.6M approximately ).
* Total Consumption and Total Cost are positively correlated with each other.
* Water accounted for 88.49% of Total Consumption.
* Total Consumption and Total Cost diverged the most when the Energy type was Water, when Total Consumption were 175,439,135 (175M approximately) higher than Total Cost.
