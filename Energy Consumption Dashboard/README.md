# Project Title - Energy Consumption Dashbaord
The dataset contains an excel file containing 

# Problem Statement:
Your company is responsible for supplying energy (water, electricity, and gas) to various buildings across different countries faces the challenge of effectively monitoring and managing energy consumption to ensure efficient operations and cost-effectiveness. However, without a centralized system to track and analyze energy usage data, the company struggles to identify trends, anomalies, and opportunities for improvement, leading to inefficiencies, increased costs, and potential service disruptions.

# My Approach:
My approach focused on creating a dynamic dashboard that visualizes trends in unit consumption and total costs for water, electricity, and gas. This involved leveraging Power BIâ€™s capabilities to clean and transform raw data, perform data modeling, create measures using DAX, conduct exploratory data analysis, and utilize various visualizations for the dashboard.

# Process Involved :
*Use of Power Query to clean and transform raw data for analysis.
* Data Modeling to connect different tables using in power BI.
* Creating some measures using DAX for the dashboard.
*Exploratory Data analysis to find patterns and producing insights.
*Use of different visualizations to create a dashboard.

# Insights :
1. Water is the dominant resource used, but the cost remains stable despite fluctuations in consumption:
Water consumption accounts for a significant portion (88.49%) of the total energy use. While water consumption fluctuates across years, with 2017 having the highest usage, the overall cost shows only a slight increase in 2019 compared to previous years. This suggests potential opportunities for conservation efforts to reduce water use without significantly impacting the budget.

2. Gas consumption and costs show a downward trend:
Gas consumption is the lowest compared to water and electricity but has significantly decreased from 2016 to 2019.
This decrease is reflected in the gas cost, which also shows a downward trend during the same period. This could be due to various factors, such as increased efficiency measures or a shift towards alternative energy sources for gas-powered activities.

3. Further analysis is needed to understand the factors behind these trends:
While the water consumption data includes a breakdown by building, additional context like building types or activities could offer deeper insights into usage patterns.
Similarly, understanding the reasons behind the decrease in gas consumption and cost would require further information, such as specific policy changes or infrastructure upgrades.

4. Additional insights can be gained by analyzing other aspects not shown in these images:
Comparing energy consumption and costs across different locations (e.g., cities, regions) could reveal valuable insights into potential efficiency improvements or resource allocation needs.
Analyzing the data by time of day or day of the week could help identify peak usage periods and potential areas for targeted conservation efforts.
By delving deeper into the data and exploring these additional aspects, a more comprehensive picture of the energy consumption patterns can be established, leading to more informed decision-making towards efficient resource management and cost optimization.

# Recommendations:
1. Conservation Strategies: Implement targeted conservation measures based on insights from the dashboard to reduce water consumption and associated costs.
2. Efficiency Measures: Investigate factors behind gas consumption decreases and explore opportunities for further efficiency improvements.
3. Enhanced Data Analysis: Expand analysis to include factors like building types, locations, and time periods for a more comprehensive understanding of energy consumption patterns.
4. Continuous Monitoring: Implement a regular monitoring system using the dashboard to track energy trends, identify anomalies, and make data-driven decisions for efficient resource management and cost optimization.

By leveraging the power of data visualization and analysis through Power BI, our project aims to provide actionable insights that drive sustainable energy practices, cost savings, and operational efficiencies across our energy supply operations.
