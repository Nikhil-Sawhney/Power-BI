# Problem Statement
Problem Statement: 
A company responsible for supplying energy (water, electricity, and gas) to various buildings across different countries faces the challenge of effectively monitoring and managing energy consumption to ensure efficient operations and cost-effectiveness. However, without a centralized system to track and analyze energy usage data, the company struggles to identify trends, anomalies, and opportunities for improvement, leading to inefficiencies, increased costs, and potential service disruptions.

# My Approach
Creating a Dashboard, showing trends of unit consumption with total cost generated from it for different types of energy (water, electrcity and gas).

# Process Involved
* Use of Power Query to clean and transform raw data for analysis.
* Creating some measures using DAX for the dashboard.
* Use of different visulizations to create a dashboard.

# Few Insights gained from the analysis include:

* Water is the dominant resource used, but the cost remains stable despite fluctuations in consumption:

Water consumption accounts for a significant portion (88.49%) of the total energy use. While water consumption fluctuates across years, with 2017 having the highest usage, the overall cost shows only a slight increase in 2019 compared to previous years. This suggests potential opportunities for conservation efforts to reduce water use without significantly impacting the budget.

* Gas consumption and costs show a downward trend:
  
Gas consumption is the lowest compared to water and electricity but has significantly decreased from 2016 to 2019.
This decrease is reflected in the gas cost, which also shows a downward trend during the same period. This could be due to various factors, such as increased efficiency measures or a shift towards alternative energy sources for gas-powered activities.

* Further analysis is needed to understand the factors behind these trends:
  
While the water consumption data includes a breakdown by building, additional context like building types or activities could offer deeper insights into usage patterns.
Similarly, understanding the reasons behind the decrease in gas consumption and cost would require further information, such as specific policy changes or infrastructure upgrades.

* Additional insights can be gained by analyzing other aspects not shown in these images:
  
Comparing energy consumption and costs across different locations (e.g., cities, regions) could reveal valuable insights into potential efficiency improvements or resource allocation needs.
Analyzing the data by time of day or day of the week could help identify peak usage periods and potential areas for targeted conservation efforts.
By delving deeper into the data and exploring these additional aspects, a more comprehensive picture of the energy consumption patterns can be established, leading to more informed decision-making towards efficient resource management and cost optimization.
