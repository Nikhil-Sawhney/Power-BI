This project tackles the challenge of optimizing energy consumption for a company supplying water, electricity, and gas across diverse locations. I leveraged the power of Power BI to create an interactive dashboard, empowering informed decision-making and driving sustainable energy practices.

# Key Challenges:
* Effectively monitor and manage energy consumption across various building types and locations.
* Identify trends, anomalies, and opportunities for improvement in energy usage.
* Ensure efficient operations and cost-effectiveness for energy resources.

# My Solution:
I designed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard featuring dedicated sections for water, electricity, and gas. Each section provides a deep dive into:
* Consumption Patterns: Analyzed usage trends across buildings and timeframes to identify potential outliers and seasonal variations. For instance, water consumption might spike during summer months, prompting investigation into irrigation practices or leak detection efforts.
* Cost Analysis: Tracked yearly costs and identified areas for potential savings. Explored cost breakdowns by energy type and building to pinpoint areas with the highest spending. This could reveal opportunities for energy-efficient upgrades or negotiations with suppliers.
* Interactive Features: Leveraged slicers and filters for user-driven exploration. Empowered users to compare consumption patterns across different building types, locations, and timeframes. This allowed for targeted analysis and identification of buildings with consistently high consumption rates.

 # Technical Skills:
* Power Query: Utilized Power Query's robust data cleansing and transformation capabilities to extract, clean, and transform raw data from separate tables into a unified and usable format for seamless analysis. This ensured data accuracy and consistency for reliable insights.
* Data Modeling: Established relationships between tables using relevant columns to create a well-structured data model. This facilitated efficient data exploration and minimized the risk of errors in calculations and visualizations.
* DAX Measures: Created custom DAX measures to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) critical for energy analysis. These included total cost, unit consumption by energy type, percentage breakdowns, and efficiency ratios like cost per unit consumed. My ability to write DAX formulas allowed me to tailor the data to the specific needs of the project and generate meaningful insights.
* Data Visualization: Designed interactive charts and graphs using Power BI's visualization tools to communicate complex energy consumption data in a clear and concise way. I employed conditional formatting strategically to highlight anomalies and areas requiring further investigation, drawing the user's attention to critical information.

# Actionable Results:
* Water as the Dominant Resource: Identified water as the dominant resource, accounting for 88.49% of total energy consumption. While water consumption fluctuated across years, the overall cost remained stable. This suggests potential for conservation efforts without significantly impacting the budget.
* Decreasing Gas Consumption and Costs: Discovered a downward trend in gas consumption and costs from 2016 to 2019. This positive development necessitated further investigation. Potential explanations include:
* Policy Changes: Investigated any company-wide initiatives or policy changes promoting energy efficiency, such as switching to LED lighting or upgrading appliances.
* Infrastructure Upgrades: Analyzed any building renovations or infrastructure upgrades that might have improved energy efficiency, such as better insulation or more efficient heating systems.
* Alternative Energy Sources: Examined if the company shifted towards alternative energy sources for gas-powered activities, such as solar panels or renewable energy sources.
* Need for Additional Data Points: The analysis revealed the need for additional data points like building types and locations for a more holistic understanding. By incorporating these details, I can:
* Benchmarking: Compare energy consumption patterns of similar building types (e.g., office buildings vs. residential buildings) to identify areas for improvement within each category.
* Location Analysis: Analyze energy consumption by geographic location to identify potential correlations with weather patterns or regional infrastructure differences. This could inform targeted conservation strategies for specific regions.

# Impact:
This project empowers the company to make data-driven decisions that promote sustainable energy practices, optimize resource allocation, and achieve cost savings. By leveraging the power of Power BI and my data analysis skills, I can pave the way for a more sustainable future.
