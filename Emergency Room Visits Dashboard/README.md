# 🚨Emergency Room Visits Dashboard🚨

Delving into the realm of healthcare data, I'm excited to share insights gleaned from my project analyzing emergency department (ED) visits across 2019 and 2020. This comprehensive dashboard offers a valuable lens to examine how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted patient flow and resource allocation.

# 🌟Patient Satisfaction: A Consistent Priority
Both 2019 (5.03) and 2020 (4.96) data reveal consistently high patient satisfaction ratings. This positive sentiment underscores the dedication of healthcare professionals to delivering exceptional care even amidst unprecedented challenges.

# 📊ER Visit Patterns: Unveiling the Pandemic's Impact
The year 2019 witnessed seasonal fluctuations in ED visits, with a peak in July (651) and a low in April (464). Notably, 2020 saw a significant decrease in total visits (4,878), potentially suggesting a delay in non-emergency care due to the pandemic. This valuable insight underscores the importance of public health initiatives encouraging timely treatment.

# ⌛Wait Time Analysis: Optimizing Efficiency
Average wait times in 2019 (35 minutes) increased to 49.39 minutes in 2020. This shift could be attributed to the pandemic's strain on healthcare resources. Interestingly, both years exhibited a trend of longer wait times on weekdays compared to weekends, suggesting potential areas for staffing adjustments or resource allocation strategies.

# 🧑‍🤝‍🧑Beyond Demographics: Tailoring Care Delivery
Across both years, white patients remained the most prevalent demographic, followed by African American and multiracial patients. This knowledge empowers healthcare providers to design targeted outreach programs catering to these specific populations.

# 💊Interdepartmental Collaboration: A Key to Streamlined Care
General practice, orthopedics, and physiotherapy consistently emerged as the top departments referring patients to the ED. By fostering stronger collaboration between these departments and the ED, healthcare institutions can potentially enhance patient flow and optimize resource utilization.

# 🔍Harnessing Data for a Healthier Future
This data-driven analysis serves as a testament to the power of information in healthcare optimization. As we emerge from the pandemic, leveraging data-driven insights will be instrumental in improving ED wait times and enhancing patient satisfaction in a post-COVID world.
