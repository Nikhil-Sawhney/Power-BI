# Project Title - People Resource Analytics

* The dataset which contains an excel file with three sheets named as 'Orders', 'People' and 'Returns' over 4 years starting from 2012 till 2015 , covering orders of 147 countries around the world.

# PROJECT GOAL
Over the past 10years, the company has experienced growth based on their increasing employees, the company's management wanted to gain insight into their company's culture, acceptance and inclusiveness, hiring and termination trend. This led to building a people analytics report.
My human resource analysis was more focused on Diversity and Inclusion in respect to the Gender, Race and Sexuality of the workforce to answer the business question.
Insights gained from the analysis include:
-Evidence of a particular race dominating the workforce,
-Likewise, the male gender dominates other genders,
-Same pattern was found in the sexuality context within the company as most employees are heterosexuals,
-Furthermore, the female employees and have smaller numbers in the managerial role and are non-existent in the director role compared to the male gender 
These highlights are pointing to a possible bias within the company's culture.
