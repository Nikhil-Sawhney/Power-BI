# Introduction: 
The Healthcare Data Analysis Dashboard on Power BI offers an in-depth examination of patient health data spanning from 2019 to 2023. Divided into two main sections — “Patient Demographics” and “Clinical Insights” — this report utilizes visualizations and DAX calculations to unveil critical trends and key performance indicators (KPIs), enabling healthcare providers to make informed decisions and optimize patient care strategies.

# Data Collection: 
The dataset comprises various attributes including patient demographics, medical conditions, admission details, and more. It's a synthetic dataset designed for educational and non-commercial use, ensuring privacy and compliance. The data cleaning is done using Microsoft Excel, removing incomplete records and irrelevant columns to enhance analysis accuracy.


# Data Preparation for Analysis using Power BI:
* Creating Separate Tables: A Date table is established to facilitate temporal analysis, linked with the main dataset. Additionally, a “Calculations” table is created for KPI measures.
* Creating Calculated Columns: New calculated columns such as Age Buckets, Readmission Indicator, and Total Stay Duration are generated to facilitate analysis and visualization.
*Creating Measurements for KPIs: Various KPIs are calculated using DAX expressions, including Readmission Count, Readmission Rate, and other pertinent metrics.

# Analysis and Visualizations for the Report: 
The report is structured into two sections for clarity:

1. Patients Demographics:

Reveals insights into the patient population demographics, including age distribution, gender distribution, and prevalent medical conditions.
Provides actionable insights for tailoring care approaches to specific patient groups, optimizing resource allocation, and improving overall patient satisfaction.
